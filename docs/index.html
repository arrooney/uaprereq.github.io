	<h1>Project Involvement</h1>
	<h2><a href="https://albertasat.ca/" target="_blank">AlbertaSat</a></h2>
	<p>AlbertaSat is a student group at the University of Alberta, we are a team of undergraduate students and faculty advisorswho build satellites!</br>
	Ex-alta 1 was not only AlbertaSat's first satellite, but also Alberta's first satellite. Ex-alta 1 has since left it's orbit, and lives on in memory.</br>
	We are now working on Ex-alta 2, an earth imaging satellite that will be designed to detect and predict forest fires using a multispectral imager and phenology.</br>
	My role on the team is as the Deputy Software Lead, in this role I have spent the summer with an NSERC USRA grant researching and implementing</br>
	an open source network stack for use on Ex-alta 2, as well as assisting in developing and integrating an Inter-integrated Circuit driver (I2C)</br>
	for the data bus.</br>
	Over the summer I was also tasked with designing and implementing automation for the Ex-alta 1 ground station. This was because operators had to be</br>
	awake at all hours to communicate with the spacecraft when overhead. I was able to create numerous bash, and FORTH scripts with hooks to C code that
	automated many routine telemetery collection tasks.

<div class="climbing" ID="climbing">
	<h1>Climbing</h1>
	<p>I have been climbing since the age of 8, and ever since beginning I haven't been able to stop!</br>
	For years I have trained for competitions on three different teams in the city, now I spend time on the weekends
		coaching young climbers.</br>
	Competition climbing has taken me all around the province, attending numerous provincial competitions. I have also
		traveled to Vancouver and Toronto to take part in the youth national championships.</br>
	I've also spent many wonderful weekends in the Canmore area climbing on real rock, and in 2016 embarked on an adventure to
		Squamish, BC to do some boulder climbing (pictured here).</br>
	In 2017 I packed up my rope and went climbing all around New Zealand, for which I owe much gratitude to all the
		helpful Kiwi's who let me hitch a ride with them around the countryside.</br>
