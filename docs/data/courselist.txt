230 Details of Courses
Courses taught at the University of Alberta are listed alphabetically. All
courses, except those taught by Faculté Saint-Jean, are described in English.
Each course is designated by its computer abbreviation and a number.
Students should use this abbreviation and number when completing any form
requiring this information.
Courses are numbered according to the following system:
000-099 Pre-University
100-199 Basic Undergraduate. Normally requires no university-level
prerequisites. Designed typically for students in the first year
of a program.
200-299 Undergraduate. Prerequisites, if any, are normally at the
100-level. Designed typically for students in the second year
of a program.
300-399 Undergraduate. Prerequisites, if any, are normally at the
200-level. Designed typically for students in the third year of a
program.
400-499 Advanced Undergraduate. Prerequisites, if any, are normally at
the 300-level. Designed typically for students in the fourth year
of a program.
500-599 Graduate. Designated for graduate students and certain
advanced or honors undergraduate students in their final
year.
600-799 Graduate Courses
800-899 Special Registrations
900-999 Graduate Thesis and Project Numbers
For the purposes of program descriptions and prerequisite designation,
courses numbered 100-199 are designated as Junior Courses and courses
numbered 200-499 are designated as Senior Courses.
Note: Some exceptions to the course number system described above have
been granted to the Faculty of Law and the Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry.
Course Description Symbols and Figures
Several symbols and figures are used to indicate the type, duration, and
weight of courses.
(1) &—Indicates “units of course weight,” and usually follows the course title. The
accompanying number indicates the weight of the course as used in computing
grade point averages and for meeting degree requirements.
A course which runs throughout the Fall/Winter (i.e., from September
through April) is usually weighted &6. A course that runs for only one term
(i.e., Fall: from September to December, or Winter: from January through
April) is usually weighted &3. Certain courses are offered over Fall/Winter
or Spring/Summer, or in one term, with weights of &1, &2, and &4. These
are considered as one-sixth, one-third, and two-thirds of a Fall/Winter or
Spring/Summer course, respectively. Some honors and graduate courses
involving research may vary in weight according to the length and difficulty
of the project. Some clinical courses may vary in weight according to the
length of clinical experience. Some courses, not included in the computation
of grade point averages, are offered for credit only and either carry a weight
of &0, or are marked as “Credit.”
Undergraduate students who take courses offered by the Faculty
of Engineering but are not registered in Engineering will have a course
weight assigned for these courses according to the protocol of their home
Faculty.
(2) fi—Denotes: “fee index,” the value used to calculate the instructional fees for
each course. The fee index is multiplied by the fee index value (given in the
appropriate subsection of §22.2) to give the dollar value of instructional fees for
the course.
For normal courses, the fee index is twice the value of the units of
course weight; for example, a course with &3 normally has fi 6. In cases
where exceptional fees considerations need to be made, the fee index is set
differently by the Board of Governors.
Note that certain programs (e.g., MD, DDS, etc.) are assessed on a
program fee basis for all or certain years. In these cases, the fee index
calculation does not apply.
(3) (x term, a-b-c)—These figures in parentheses give information on when the
course is offered and the hours of instruction required by the course in a week,
or in some cases the total time in a term.
In the case of a single-term course, the term in which the course is
given is mentioned (item x). The designation “either term” means that the
course may be offered either in the first term or in the second term or in
each term, at the discretion of the department concerned. The designation
“variable” means that the course may be taught either as a single-term or
as a full-session course.
Item a indicates lecture hours. Item b indicates seminar hour(s),
demonstration hours (d), clinic hours (c), or lecture-laboratory hours
(L). Item c indicates laboratory hours. For two-term courses, the hours
of instruction are the same in both terms unless otherwise indicated.
The expression 3/2 means 3 hours of instruction every second week; 2s/2
means 2 seminar hours every second week.
Examples:
(first term, 3-0-3): a course taught in first term with 3 hours lecture, no
seminar, and 3 hours lab per week.
(second term, 0-1s-2): a course taught in second term with no lectures,
1 seminar hour, and 2 hours of lab per week.
(either term, 3-0-0): a course taught in either first or second term, or
each term, with 3 lecture hours per week, no seminar, and no lab.
(two-term, 3-0-3): a course taught over both first and second term with
three lecture hours, no seminar, and three hours lab per week.
(variable, 3-0-0): a course which may be taught in either first or second
term or over two terms with three lecture hours per week, no seminar, and
no lab.
(4) Prerequisite—This provides information on courses which must be successfully
completed before registering in the more advanced course.
Corequisite—This provides information on courses which must be taken before
or at the same time as the course described in the listing.
Note: Departments are authorized to cancel the registration of those students
registered in a course offered by the department if they do not meet the
prerequisite and/or corequisite requirements stated in the course description
in this Calendar.
(5) [Department]— This indicates the department responsible for registration for
interdepartmental courses. Normally, courses will be credited to the discipline
listed in the square brackets.
(6) Open Studies Courses— O indicates a course available to students of Open
Studies. L indicates that a course is available to Open Studies students on a
delayed registration basis only (see §220.2.2).
Important: Registration Procedures for Two-Term Courses
Students are strongly advised to refer to the Registration and Courses
menu at www.registrarsoffice.ualberta.ca for details. Two-term courses are
normally offered over two terms (either Fall/Winter or Spring/Summer). In a few
instances, two-term courses are offered within a single term. In all cases these
are identifiable in the Class Schedule because they consist of part A and part B
(e.g., English 111A and 111B).
To successfully register in a two-term course, students, must do the
following:
•	 Register in both the part A and part B for all types of sections offered (Lectures,
Labs, Seminars, etc.);
•	 Register in the same section numbers for part A and part B of a course (e.g.,
Lecture A1 for both part A and part B, and Lab E3 for both part A and part B);
•	 Register in all the appropriate sections on the same day.
All of the above must be done or the course registration is invalid and
will be deleted. Invalid registrations will be deleted nightly. It is the student’s
responsibility to attempt the course registration again, subject to availability.
Example: A student wishes to register in ABCD 101, a two-term course.
It has a lecture and a lab section. Based on the student’s timetable planning,
decides to take Lecture C3 and Lab C8. The student must add
In Fall Term ABCD 101A Lec C3 and ABCD 101A Lab C8,
and
In Winter Term ABCD 101B Lec C3 and ABCD 101B Lab C8.
All these sections must be added on the same day to successfully register.
Otherwise the registration in ABCD 101 will be deleted overnight and the
student’s place in the course will be lost.
Course Renumbering
Over the years many courses have been renumbered. Old numbers can be
found within individual course listings of previous Calendar editions.
Courses on Reserve
Courses not offered in the past four years are removed from this Calendar
and placed on Reserve. These courses may be taught again in the future, in
which case they would be brought back into the active Course Listings and
placed in the Calendar. Information about Reserve Courses is available through
the Registrar’s Office, the University Secretariat, and Faculty Offices.
Faculty Specific Regulations Regarding Courses

subjects taught by a Faculty, please consult the Undergraduate Programs section

Physical Requirements for University Courses
The University has a commitment to the education of all academically
qualified students and special services are frequently provided on campus to
assist disabled students.
Nevertheless, some courses make certain unavoidable demands on students
with respect to the possession of a certain level of physical skill or ability if the
academic objectives of the course are to be realized. In case of doubt, students
are advised to contact the Department concerned and Specialized Support and
Disability Services (SSDS), Office of the Dean of Students.
Because support services cannot be guaranteed for all off-campus courses,
instructors may be obliged to refuse registration in such courses.
Course Availability
The following is a comprehensive course listing of all the approved courses
that the University of Alberta may offer. The appearance of a course in this list
does not guarantee that the course will actually be offered. The most current
information on courses is available on Bear Tracks at https://www.beartracks.

Notes
(1) The Department reserves the right to place students in the language course
appropriate to their level of language skill.
(2) Placement tests may be administered in order to assess prior background.
Students with an Arabic language background should consult a Department
advisor. Such students may be granted advanced placement and directed to
register in a more advanced course suitable to their level of ability. Students
seeking to fulfill their Language Other than English requirement may begin
at any one appropriate level, but must take the full &6 in one language.
(3) The Department will withhold credit from students completing courses for
which prior background is deemed to make them ineligible. For example,
100-level courses are normally restricted to students with little or no prior
knowledge in that language. Should a student with matriculation standing,
or those possessing prior background (such as native speakers or those for
whom it is their first language) register in the 100-level course, credit may
be withheld.

Notes
(1) The Department reserves the right to place students in the language course
appropriate to their level of language skill.
(2) Placement tests may be administered in order to assess prior background.
Students with an Asian (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) language background
should consult a Department advisor. Such students may be granted advanced
placement and directed to register in a more advanced course suitable to
their level of ability or they may be encouraged to seek “Credit by Special
Assessment” (see §44.5) when appropriate.
(3) The Department will withhold credit from students completing courses for
which prior background is deemed to make them ineligible. For example,
100-level courses are normally restricted to students with little or no prior
knowledge in that language. Should a student with matriculation standing,
or those possessing prior background (such as native speakers or those for
whom it is their first language) register in the 100-level courses, credit may
be withheld.

FREN
Department of Modern Languages and Cultural Studies
Faculty of Arts
Notes
(1) The Department reserves the right to place students in the language course
appropriate to their level of language skill.
(2) Placement tests may be administered in order to assess prior background.
Students with a French language background should consult a Department
advisor. Such students may be granted advanced placement and directed to
register in an advanced course more suitable to their level of ability. Students
seeking to fulfill their Language Other than English requirement may begin
at any one appropriate level, but must take the full &6 in one language.
(3) The Department will withhold credit from students completing courses for
which prior background is deemed to make them ineligible. For example,
100-level courses are normally restricted to students with little or no prior
knowledge in that language. Should a student with matriculation standing,
or those possessing prior background (such as native speakers or those for
whom it is their first language) register in the 100-level course, credit may
be withheld.
(4) FREN 311, 312, 313, 314, 315, 316 pursue mastery of the language and introduce
students to the study of texts (e.g., literary, journalistic, cinematographic). The
double focus allows for applied language development while providing an
in-depth introduction to the study of major cultural texts.

Notes
(1) The Department reserves the right to place students in the language course
appropriate to their level of language skill.
(2) Placement tests may be administered in order to assess prior background.
Students with a German language background should consult a Department
advisor. Such students may be granted advanced placement and directed to
register in an advanced course more suitable to their level of ability. Students
seeking to fulfill their Language Other than English requirement may begin
at any one appropriate level, but must take the full &6 in one language.
(3) The Department will withhold credit from students completing courses for
which prior background is deemed to make them ineligible. For example,
100-level courses are normally restricted to students with little or no prior
knowledge in that language. Should a student with matriculation standing,
or those possessing prior background (such as native speakers or those for
whom it is their first language) register in the 100-level course, credit may
be withheld.

Notes
(1) The Department reserves the right to place students in the language course
appropriate to their level of language skill.
(2) Placement tests may be administered in order to assess prior background.
Students with a Hungarian language background should consult a Department
advisor. Such students may be granted advanced placement and directed to
register in an advanced course more suitable to their level of ability. Students
seeking to fulfill their Language Other than English requirement may begin
at any one appropriate level, but must take the full &6 in one language.
(3) The Department will withhold credit from students completing courses for
which prior background is deemed to make them ineligible. For example,
100-level courses are normally restricted to students with little or no prior
knowledge in that language. Should a student with matriculation standing,
or those possessing prior background (such as native speakers or those for
whom it is their first language) register in the 100-level course, credit may
be withheld.

Notes
(1) The Department reserves the right to place students in the language course
appropriate to their level of language skill.
(2) Placement tests may be administered in order to assess prior background.
Students with a Spanish language background should consult a Department
advisor. Such students may be granted advanced placement and directed to
register in an advanced course more suitable to their level of ability. Students
seeking to fulfill their Language Other than English requirement may begin
at any one appropriate level, but must take the full &6 in one language.
(3) The Department will withhold credit from students completing courses for
which prior background is deemed to make them ineligible. For example,
100-level courses are normally restricted to students with little or no prior
knowledge in that language. Should a student with matriculation standing,
or those possessing prior background (such as native speakers or those for
whom it is their first language) register in the 100-level course, credit may
be withheld.
(4) All courses at the 300-level, except SPAN 330 and 360 which are taught in
English, include language acquisition among other course requirements.

Notes
(1) The Department reserves the right to place students in the language course
appropriate to their level of language skill.
(2) Placement tests may be administered in order to assess prior background.
Students with a Ukrainian language background should consult a Department
advisor. Such students may be granted advanced placement and directed to
register in an advanced course more suitable to their level of ability. Students
seeking to fulfill their Language Other than English requirement may begin
at any one appropriate level, but must take the full &6 in one language.
(3) The Department will withhold credit from students completing courses for

100-level courses are normally restricted to students with little or no prior

or those possessing prior background (such as native speakers or those for
whom it is their first language) register in the 100-level course, credit may
